\title{Simulated Unbalanced Panel Data for Cobb-Douglas Production Function Analysis}
\format{
A data frame with 180 rows (30 firms × 6 years) and 6 variables:
\describe{
  \item{firm}{integer variable representing firm identifier (1 to 30)}
  \item{year}{integer variable representing year identifier (1 to 6)}
  \item{status}{factor variable representing firm status with three levels:
                "Pre-entry" (firms not yet entered),
                "Market participation" (active firms),
                "Out of market" (firms that have exited)}
  \item{sales}{numeric variable representing firm sales/output, generated from
               Cobb-Douglas production function with technology shocks.
               Only available for firms with "Market participation" status}
  \item{capital}{numeric variable representing capital input, following log-normal
                 distribution with firm-specific effects and time trend.
                 Only available for firms with "Market participation" status}
  \item{labor}{numeric variable representing labor input, following log-normal
               distribution with firm-specific effects and time trend.
               Only available for firms with "Market participation" status}

\description{
A simulated dataset containing firm-level panel data with firm status tracking,
entry, exit, and random missing values for estimating Cobb-Douglas production functions.
The data follows the structure: Sales = A × Capital^α × Labor^β × exp(technology_shock),
where α = 0.3 and β = 0.6.
}
\details{
The dataset exhibits several realistic features of firm-level panel data:
\itemize{
  \item 50\% of firms (15 firms) have complete data for all 6 years with "Market participation" status
  \item 50\% of firms (15 firms) have entry and exit patterns with different start and end years
  \item Status variable tracks firm lifecycle: Pre-entry → Market participation → Out of market
  \item Economic variables (sales, capital, labor) are only available during market participation
  \item Additional random missing values (approx. 2\%) in sales, capital, and labor variables
  \item Firm-specific effects and time trends in capital and labor inputs
  \item Technology shocks affecting production output
